==> What is framework ?

Playwright framework is the structured setup we build around it for:

Test organization
Reusability
Configurations (environments, browsers, retries, etc.)
Reporting (Allure, HTML)
Utilities (API calls, DB connections, Page Objects)

==> Core Components of a Playwright Framework

Playwright Test Runner
Built-in test runner (@playwright/test) handles test execution, assertions, fixtures.
Configuration File (playwright.config.ts)
Central place for environment setup:
i) baseURL
ii) Browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
iii) Parallel execution
iv) Retries
v) Reporters (HTML/Allure)
Page Object Model (POM)
Reusable classes for each page (loginPage, dashboardPage, etc.)
Keeps tests clean and maintainable.
Fixtures
Pre/post conditions (e.g., login before each test).
Test Data Management
Externalize data (JSON, CSV, API-driven).
Reporting
Built-in HTML reports or external ones (like Allure).
Utilities / Helpers
Custom functions (API helpers, DB queries, environment handlers).
